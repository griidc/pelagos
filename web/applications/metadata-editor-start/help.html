The GRIIDC Metadata Editor is a web application that generates ISO 19115-2 compliant metadata files in XML format. To generate a complete Metadata file, several fields in various sections must be completed in the Metadata Editor form.

<dt><h2>Toolbar buttons:</h2></dt>
<dd>
<h3>Load from File:</h3>
<li>This button will load the form with information from a previously generated file stored on your local computer. This file can be a full metadata file, a temporary saved file, or a template. The Metadata Editor expects a file with ISO 19115-2 XML content.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Load from GRIIDC Dataset:</h3>
<li>This button will pre-populate the form with information about a dataset previously submitted to GRIIDC.  Your dataset must have already been submitted and have a GRIIDC UDI to use this option.  Not all fields will be populated using this method as submissions do not contain sufficient information to complete the required fields.
</li>
</dd>
<dd><h3>Save to File:</h3>
<li>This button will save the contents of the form to an ISO 19115-2 XML metadata file on your local computer. The file will be correctly formed XML, but it is not checked for completion of all required elements. This feature is useful for saving the data in the form so it can be continued at a later time, or in creating a reusable metadata template with commonly used information..
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Clear Form:</h3>
<li>This button will reload a blank form.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Check and Save to File:</h3>
<li>This button will check that all required fields are completed then save the contents of the form to an ISO 19115-2 XML metadata file on your local computer.  This file is correctly formed XML adhering to the ISO 19115-2 Metadata standard but it is NOT validated at this stage.  Once saved, the metadata can be submitted to GRIIDC for validation through the Dataset Submission utility (<a href="https://griidc.org/dataset-submission">https://griidc.org/dataset-submission</a>)
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Help:</h3>
<li>This button will launch a dialog box that includes instructions and help text for using the ISO 19115-2 Metadata Editor.</li></dd>

<dt><h2>Tabs/Sections:</h2></dt>
<dd><h3>Dataset Contact:</h3>
<li>Contains information about the point of contact for the dataset (i.e., the person primarily responsible for the creation of the dataset).
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Dataset Information:</h3>
<li>Contains information describing and identifying the dataset, includes elements such as title, abstract, and data parameters.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Keywords:</h3>
<li>Contains the keywords relating to theme, place and topic category. To add keywords, either type or select a keyword in the keyword field and click the add button. To delete a keyword from the list, select and highlight the keyword in the list, and click remove. The topic category keywords are broad categories predefined by ISO and may not be very applicable to your dataset, but at least one topic category keyword must be supplied.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Data Extent:</h3>
<li>Contains information describing the spatial and temporal extent of the dataset. A set of bounding box coordinates and a time period are preferred. If your dataset does not have any relevant spatial or temporal components (e.g., some laboratory experiment data) select the checkbox: &ldquo;This dataset does not have any relevant spatial or temporal components&rdquo; and provide a short explanation such as &ldquo;No relevant geographic or temporal extents for this dataset&rdquo;.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Distribution Info:</h3>
<li>Contains information describing the distribution parameters for the file(s) in the dataset, includes elements such as size, compression technique and URL where file can be obtained.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Distribution Contact:</h3>
<li>Contains information about the distributor of the dataset.  If the dataset is hosted at GRIIDC, the GRIIDC contact information should be used.
</li></dd>
<dd><h3>Metadata Contact:</h3>
<li>Contains information about the point of contact for the metadata.  In many cases, this will be the same individual as the Dataset Contact.
